# Image-Search-engine
The basic search engines we used today are Google, Bing etc. which are based on keywords. However when it comes to images, we search differently. There are three ways to search for images, they are search by meta-data, search by example and a combination of both. Search by meta data involves searching for images based on tags. This is similar to the keyword search on the web. Flicr uses, search by tag. Search by image involves searching that is based on the contents of the image. We need not provide any keywords. This is a Content Based Image Retrieval. We are using a hybrid approach that is a combination of the two methods to find our image. 

The steps involved in our project are as follows: 

    Step 1: Using a 3D color histogram and KAZE as our Image Descriptor 
    
    Step 2: Extracting Features from the dataset and storing them 
    
    Step 3: Developing a search
    
    Step 4: Executing the search
